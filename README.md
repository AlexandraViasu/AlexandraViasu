# Welcome to Coding Crib! 👋

## About Me
Hello there! I'm Alex (she/her), a recent graduate from CodeClan. My journey in the tech world began with a background primarily focused on logistics, but my passion for the tech industry led me to make a career transition into software engineering. I thrive on embracing challenges and I am enthusiastic about anything tech related.

## What I Bring to the Table
- 🚀 **Skills**: Proficient in AGILE methodologies, pair programming, and full-stack development, honed during my time at CodeClan.
- 🎨 **Creativity**: A creative spirit that finds expression through drawing, sketching, and designing, bringing the ✨spark✨ to my work.
- 🌍 **Explorer at Heart**: An avid traveler (visited 15 countries so far!) and a lover of diverse cultures, always eager to learn and grow through new experiences.
- 🎮 **Gamer & Bibliophile**: Finding joy in immersive gaming experiences (half proud and half ashamed that I have 2k+ hours in DotA2) and the captivating world of literature.

Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects! 🤝
